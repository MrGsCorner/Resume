                <h3>Experience:</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>I am working towards my 7th year of teaching at Magnet Cove Elementary.  I am currently teaching literacy, math, science, and social studies. I spent a year at Drew Central as a student-teacher. After graduating from UAM, I went to work for 
                   Eastside Elementary in Warren, AR. This is my seventh year at Magnet Cove, and I look forward to many more! I have also 
                   completed my Master’s of Science in Reading in Education. I am now working towards getting CALT certification, and I will finish it by the end of the school year. I am currently finishing up the course work to get k-12 Online Teaching Certification through a scholarship I was awarded from the University of Arkansas..</p> 
                <h3>Future Educational Goals</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, I am working towards my K -12 Online Teaching Certification, and I will complete the assessment portion by the end of the summer. I also plan on taking the CALT Examine and my Praxis II Reading Specialists Examine over the summer. Once completed, I will be licensed in dyslexia intervention in Arkansas and throughout the United States. In the future, I plan on pursuing my EDs in Reading.
